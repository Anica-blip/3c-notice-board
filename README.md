## What This App Does

3C Notice Board is a slideshow-style app with two faces:

- **Public Viewer** — a swipe/slide-through board of notice pages, newest page first, with a bottom bar to move between pages. No login required.
- **Admin Panel** — a login-gated control room where Chef Anica manages every page: upload new media, or link an existing Cloudflare/R2 URL to reuse an asset without re-uploading.

### Page format
- Each page is **portrait**, **landscape**, or **square**.
- Pages can hold an **image**, **video**, or **audio** file.
- Video/audio pages carry no on-player icons — playback is controlled by a single **Play** button below the media, matching the page's aspect (9:16, 16:9, or square).
- The most recently added page is always shown first, on both admin and public sides.

### Sharing
- Every content page (excluding the landing page) has:
  - A **Download** button (saves that page's media)
  - A **Share** button (copies that page's direct URL to clipboard)

### Branding
- 3C Thread To Success™ logo + favicon on both public and admin views
- Titles in neon light-purple, ~32px
- No emojis in the interface — symbols only for buttons and controls
